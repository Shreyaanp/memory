# Phase 1 Fixes - Real Face Acceptance Priority

## Critical Issues Fixed (based on code review):

### 1. **Removed rPPG Hard Gate** ✅
- **Issue**: rPPG was hard-rejecting real faces due to lack of robust signal processing
- **Fix**: Made rPPG supplementary (15% weight) instead of critical gate
- **Impact**: Won't reject real faces on missing pulse; still contributes to mask detection

### 2. **Fixed IR "Thermal" Misnomer** ✅
- **Issue**: RealSense IR is NIR reflectance, not thermal emission; treating it as temperature is physically wrong
- **Fix**: Renamed conceptually to "IR spatial variance," reduced weight from 35% to 20%
- **Removed**: Hard rejection gate on uniform patterns
- **Impact**: More lenient on real faces with various skin tones/lighting

### 3. **Removed Stacked Hard Gates** ✅
- **Removed**:
  - rPPG no-pulse hard reject
  - IR uniform pattern hard reject
  - Stereo consistency hard reject
- **Fix**: Let all components contribute via weighted fusion instead
- **Impact**: Prevents cascading false rejections on real faces

### 4. **Guarded Debug Logging** ✅
- **Issue**: Frequent std::cout in hot paths (per-frame analysis) impacting latency
- **Fix**: Added `ENABLE_DEBUG_LOGGING` flag (set to false)
- **Impact**: Better real-time performance

### 5. **Fixed Fusion Inconsistency** ✅
- **Issue**: `process_frame_with_temporal_context` was recalculating overall_liveness_score without rPPG
- **Fix**: Removed redundant recalculation; use score from process_frame
- **Impact**: Consistent scoring across all code paths

### 6. **Adjusted Scoring Weights** ✅
- **New weights** (optimized for real face acceptance):
  - Depth: 35% (best for 2D attacks)
  - IR Texture: 30% (surface analysis)
  - rPPG: 15% (supplementary, non-critical)
  - Temporal: 10% (consistency)
  - Cross-Modal: 10% (validation)
- **Guardrail**: Excludes rPPG (only checks depth, IR, temporal, cross-modal ≥ 50%)

## Testing Protocol (Systematic):

### **Phase 1: Real Human Face Baseline** ✅ PRIORITY
1. Test with spectacles
2. Test without spectacles
3. **Requirement**: 100% acceptance rate

### **Phase 2: 2D Attacks**
1. Photo on screen
2. Photo on paper
3. Photo on t-shirt
4. Video playback
5. **Requirement**: 100% rejection

### **Phase 3: 3D Plastic Masks**
1. Plastic mask attack
2. **Requirement**: Reliable rejection

## Remaining Issues (for future iterations):

1. **rPPG Needs Robust Signal Processing**:
   - Add bandpass filter (0.7-2.0 Hz)
   - Motion compensation
   - CHROM/POS methods
   - Derive FPS from frame timestamps
   - Increase window to 6-10 seconds

2. **ROI Mapping Still Scale-Based**:
   - Need proper rs2::align or intrinsics/extrinsics projection
   - Current scale-only mapping causes mis-projections off-axis

3. **Temporal Analysis Placeholders**:
   - detect_blink needs EAR/PERCLOS implementation
   - micro_motion needs KLT feature tracking
   - breathing analysis needs implementation

4. **Adaptive Thresholds**:
   - Distance-aware depth thresholds
   - Adaptive to environmental factors
